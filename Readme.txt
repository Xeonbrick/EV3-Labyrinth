-=[ Introduction ]=-

This program is written for the old LabView-based EV3-G programming language.
It is incompatible with the new Scratch / Python based IDEs!

To load Labyrinth onto your EV3 brick, open the .ev3 file in your Home or
Education Edition Lego Mindstorms software and download it onto the brick in the
usual manner.

BEWARE, that due to the complexity of Labyrinth, it might take several minutes
for the software to open the program. Please be patient!

Upon loading Labyrinth onto the EV3, you need to run the install wizard before
your first play (search for a file called "2_Install").

Now you're all set!
Search for the file "1_Labyrinth" to run the game.



-=[ How to play ]=-

After starting a new game or continuing a game, use the arrow buttons on your
EV3 brick to navigate:

[Left]: Turn left
[Right]: Turn right
[Up]: Move forward, enter door, climb ladder, activate switch or collect key
[Down]: Move backward or enter door (except main door)
[Center]: Open menu

While playing Labyrinth you will encounter numerous different elements:

- Normal Hallways:
  Use your arrow buttons to walk through them.

- Doors:
  Are locked by default and cannot be entered.
  Doors that have been unlocked by a lever can be entered using [Up] or [Down].

- Levers:
  Can be activated using [Up] to unlock a door.

- Keys:
  Can be collected by stepping on them.

- Main Door:
  Is the exit to the dungeon and the ultimate goal of the game.
  Has a different design to normal doors and can be entered using [Up] if all 3
  keys have been collected.

- Ladders:
  Take you to another level of the Labyrinth and can be climbed using [Up].

- Spikes:
  Will stab you to death if you stay on them for longer than 1.2 Seconds.



-=[ Menu ]=-

Press the center button to access the menu, where a map of the current level
of Labyrinth is displayed. You have the option of resuming your gameplay
or to save & quit.



-=[ Saving your progress ]=-

You may at any point decide to save your progress through the menu option, so
you can resume your game at a later date exactly where you left.
ALWAYS, exit the game through this option, as otherwise your progress will
be lost! You may safely use the EV3's [Back] button on the title screen.
Your progress will be saved even after exiting the program or shutting
down your EV3. If a firmware reset is perfored, all progress will be lost.



-=[ Death ]=-

Just like in real-life, dying in Labyrinth is rather undesirable.
Your entire progress will be lost and you need to start at the beginning again.
The only way to die is by being stabbed by spikes!



-=[ Walkthrough ]=-

Labyrinth is not for the faint-hearted!
If you feel lost or overwhelmed you can refer to the complete walkthrough of
Labyrinth, contained in a seperate file called "Walkthrough.txt".
Using the walktrough however, will destroy the satisfaction of having completed
the game all by oneself and should therefore only be used as a last resort!
For a more subtle hint you may refer to the map that's displayed in the menu.
